# d3js-game-of-life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway, in which after an initial input, a system of cells evolves following 4 well-defined rules. 
This is a take on this experiment using d3.js

Instructions for local use:

- cd d3js-game-of-life

Run a local server, there are many alternatives. Eg you can use Python:
